# Windows 10 IOT Core Hand On Lab

This site contains the instructions for the Windows 10 IoT Core HOL using i.MX 6. All tools, binaries, source and certificates have already been installed for you on the lab machines.

## Turning on the lab machine

When you turn on the lab machine you will see 2 boot options:

- HOL Lab
- Host

Please select `HOL Lab` as this is the VHD that contains all the required binaries, tooling, source and certificates. If while doing the lab you find that your machine is in an unstable state please speak to one of the proctors and they will either be able to help you or reset the VHD.
